## Q: How do you ensure that an application scales efficiently as user traffic grows? What are the key architectural decisions you would focus on to support high availability and scalability?

The first step is ensuring that the frontend architecture is modular and componentized to allow reusability and maintainability. I also ensure that the application is stateless where possible, offloading state to distributed storage solutions like Redis or cloud databases.

From a backend API interaction perspective, I implement caching strategies to reduce API load, such as memoization or caching results in the client layer. I leverage server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) with Next.js to reduce the load on both the server and the client.

For handling scaling efficiently, I use horizontal scaling techniques on the backend services, implement load balancers, and deploy the application on cloud platforms that offer automatic scaling. On the frontend, using a CDN for static assets ensures that the content is distributed globally, reducing the time-to-first-byte (TTFB).

### How would you balance scalability with maintainability and developer productivity in a fast-paced environment?

In one of my previous projects, we had to prepare for a marketing campaign that would exponentially increase user traffic. By using a CDN for assets, lazy-loading components, and optimizing our API request patterns, we managed to maintain a consistent user experience even under high load, without increasing server costs.
