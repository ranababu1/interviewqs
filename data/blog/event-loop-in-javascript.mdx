## Q: What is the event loop in JavaScript, and how does it work?

**Answer:**

The **event loop** is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations by offloading tasks to the system kernel whenever possible.

**How It Works:**

1. **Call Stack:** Holds the functions to be executed.
2. **Web APIs:** Browser features like `setTimeout`, `DOM events`.
3. **Callback Queue:** Functions waiting to be executed.
4. **Event Loop:** Moves tasks from the callback queue to the call stack when it's empty.

**Example:**

```javascript
console.log('Start')

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout')
}, 0)

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('Promise')
})

console.log('End')
```

**Output**

`Start`

`End`

`Promise`

`Timeout`

**Explanation:**

- Synchronous code runs first (Start, End).
- Microtasks (Promise) run before macrotasks (setTimeout).
