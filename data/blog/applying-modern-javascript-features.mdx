## Q: JavaScript's ES6+ introduced new features like arrow functions, promises, async/await, and destructuring. Can you walk me through how these modern JavaScript features can be used to improve code readability and performance in a real-world application?

ES6+ features like `let` and `const` help make code more predictable by avoiding the scope issues associated with `var`. Arrow functions `(() => {})` provide cleaner syntax and lexically bind the this context, preventing common errors in event handlers and callbacks.

Promises and `async/await` greatly improve readability by avoiding callback hell and making asynchronous code look synchronous. Destructuring assignments `(const { a, b } = obj)` reduce boilerplate code, making functions more concise and readable.

For performance, using modern features like `Map`, `Set`, and `WeakMap` provides faster access and manipulation of collections compared to traditional objects or arrays for certain use cases.

### In TypeScript, how do you ensure strict type safety while maintaining flexibility in your codebase? What challenges have you encountered with TypeScript, and how have you addressed them?

In TypeScript, strict typing catches errors during development, making the codebase more reliable and reducing runtime bugs. For flexibility, I use generics to create reusable components while still ensuring type safety. Challenges like managing complex types are handled using utility types like `Partial`, `Pick`, and `Omit`.
