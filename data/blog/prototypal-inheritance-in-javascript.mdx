## Q: How does prototypal inheritance work in JavaScript? Provide an example.

In JavaScript, objects inherit properties from other objects via the prototype chain.

**How It Works:**

- Every object has a `__proto__` property pointing to its prototype.
- When accessing a property, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain until it finds it.

**Example:**

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name
}

Person.prototype.greet = function () {
  return `Hello, ${this.name}`
}

const alice = new Person('Alice')
console.log(alice.greet()) // Outputs: Hello, Alice
```

**_Explanation:_**

- Person is a constructor function.
- greet is added to Person.prototype.
- Instances of Person inherit greet via the prototype chain.
