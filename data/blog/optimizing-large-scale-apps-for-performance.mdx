## Q: You've been tasked with optimizing the performance of a large-scale React application experiencing significant latency. Describe your approach to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks. How do you prioritize which optimizations to implement?

First, I start by profiling the application using tools like Chrome DevTools and Lighthouse to identify areas with performance issues, such as slow rendering or large bundle sizes. I focus on optimizing the critical rendering path by lazy-loading non-essential components and leveraging React’s built-in tools like React.memo and useCallback to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

I also audit the state management system to ensure we’re not overusing context or global states, as this can lead to unnecessary re-renders. I minimize the number of third-party libraries, optimize asset loading through techniques like code splitting, tree-shaking, and minification, and employ caching mechanisms via a service worker or CDN.

Prioritization depends on impact versus effort. I’ll focus on low-hanging fruits like bundle size reduction first, then address more complex issues such as optimizing API call patterns or heavy computations.

### Can you provide an example of a time when you significantly improved performance in a production app? What tools and techniques did you use and how did you measure success?

In one of my previous projects, the app’s time-to-interactive was excessively long due to a large number of third-party libraries. I reduced the bundle size by dynamically importing libraries only when necessary, eliminating unused imports, and using a CDN for heavy assets. I also replaced synchronous API calls with an async batching mechanism. The time-to-interactive improved by 40%.
