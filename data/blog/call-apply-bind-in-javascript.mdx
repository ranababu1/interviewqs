## Q: Explain the difference between `call`, `apply`, and `bind` methods.

In JavaScript, `call`, `apply`, and `bind` are methods available on function objects. They allow you to control the execution context (the `this` value) of a function. Let's explore each method and their differences:

## The `call` Method

The `call` method invokes a function with a specified `this` value and individual arguments.

```javascript
function greet(greeting) {
  console.log(`${greeting}, ${this.name}!`)
}

const person = { name: 'Alice' }

greet.call(person, 'Hello') // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

## The `apply` Method

The `apply` method is similar to `call`, but it accepts arguments as an array.

```javascript
function introduce(greeting, profession) {
  console.log(`${greeting}, I'm ${this.name} and I'm a ${profession}.`)
}

const person = { name: 'Bob' }

introduce.apply(person, ['Hi', 'developer'])
// Output: Hi, I'm Bob and I'm a developer.
```

## The `bind` Method

Unlike `call` and `apply`, `bind` doesn't immediately invoke the function. Instead, it returns a new function with a fixed `this` value.

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`)
}

const person = { name: 'Charlie' }

const boundHello = sayHello.bind(person)
boundHello() // Output: Hello, Charlie!
```

## Key Differences

1. **Invocation:**

   - `call` and `apply` invoke the function immediately.
   - `bind` returns a new function without invoking it.

2. **Argument passing:**

   - `call` accepts arguments individually.
   - `apply` accepts arguments as an array.
   - `bind` can accept some or all arguments when creating the bound function.

3. **Use cases:**
   - Use `call` when you know the number of arguments.
   - Use `apply` when arguments are in an array or you don't know their number in advance.
   - Use `bind` when you want to fix the `this` value but invoke the function later.

Understanding these methods helps in writing more flexible and reusable code, especially when working with callbacks, event handlers, or when you need to borrow methods from other objects.
